## Where to place the input file ?

Please add the input file in /tmp folder with the name of the file as INPUT.

## How to run this ?

Please go to the source folder and compile the package using the below command

> javac Main.java

Once compiled use te below command to run the program

> java Main

## How to check the output ?

Once the program is executed, you should see the below log line

> "Output written successfully."

This means the program has successfully written the file in /tmp folder with the name of the file
being OUTPUT

## What is the time complexity of the program ?

Checking if 2 sentences have a single word difference is done in O(m) time, where
m is length of one of 2 sentences excluding the date and time.

We do this for every sentence group. So if the number of sentence groups are ns and each sentence
group has p members, the time complexity is O(ns*p*m).

We also sort each group therefore the total time complexity is O(nlogn) + O(ns*p*m)

## How can this be scaled ?

To scale this better we should keep a track of already seen actions like "is eating at a diner",
"is running into the car" etc. If we see a record with the same action, we don't have to check if
the sentence differs by a word because the only way it can now change is the name, which we can
save a set. Basically have a Action => List of names map. This will eliminate a lot of comparisons

## If you had two weeks to do this task, what would you have done differently? What would be better?

I would have scaled as per the above suggestion. I would have worked on making sure we don't need
to sort the final group list based on the date and time. This can be possible because the events are
in order
